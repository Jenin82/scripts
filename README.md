# Scripts ‚ú®

Welcome to **Scripts**, a project that allows you to **generate SSH commands** from a friendly **web UI**!  
Manage your servers, run handy scripts remotely, and streamline your dev operations ‚Äì all from one place.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Web UI**  
   - Open the web interface (e.g., `index.html`) where you can fill in your SSH details:
     - **PEM File Path** (Default: `~/.ssh/`)
     - **SSH User** (Default: `root`)
     - **IP/Domain** (e.g., `example.com`)
     - **Port** (Default: `22`)  

2. **Select a Script**  
   - Choose from the scripts listed in `index.json`.  
   - If a script has parameters, you can fill those in.  

3. **Get Your Command**  
   - The UI automatically generates the **SSH command** you need.  
   - Simply copy and run it in your terminal to execute the script on the remote server.
